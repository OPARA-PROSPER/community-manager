# Taking Out the Trash

These are my personal guidelines that I've built up while dealing with a rather large community (on the order of tens of thousands). Smaller communities may require a lighter touch.

## When to Ban

* You've identified a [troll](trolling-defined.md)
* Repeat offenders - people should never get a third warning
* Flagrant violations of public decency &mdash; spam, prurient content, blatantly insulting or harassing, _any_ sort of threat

## When to Warn

* Any other violation of the community's code of conduct that doesn't result in a ban
