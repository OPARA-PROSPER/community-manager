# The Three Types of Social Networks

There are three general types of social networks:

* The Single Community
* Confederation of Communities
* Federated Communities

Each type has its own strengths and weaknesses. Each requires a different approach to moderation. When building a service that has a social network component, it is important to understand which it is you are trying to build so that they can be administrated and moderated properly.

A community is a collection of individuals that unite around a common goal. Whether that is for protection and sharing of resources as was the most common reason for community building throughout most of human history or for more esoteric goals such as is more common in modern contexts, a community:

* Consists of people
* Has a purpose
* Has social norms

When one is responsible for a community, one's purpose should be to:

1. Help the community thrive or, at a minimum, survive
1. Achieve the purpose of the community
1. Guide and enforce the social norms

## Single Community

* People
    * One well-defined group of individuals
* Purpose
    * Varies greatly from community to community but generally has one well-defined purpose
* Social Norms
    * One set of social norms built specifically to direct the efforts of the group toward its goals

Examples:

* Message boards such as https://discuss.atom.io
* A book club

## Confederation of Communities

* People
    * Many well-defined groups that rarely interact with each other or have significant barriers impeding cross-pollination between groups
* Purpose
    * Each group has its own goals, often orthogonal or even directly opposing to the goals of other groups in the confederation
* Social Norms
    * While there may be some basic shared norms, they are often rudimentary and allow for great variance between groups

Examples:

* [GitHub](https://github.com)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com)

## Federated Communities

* People
    * Many ill-defined groups that have varying amounts of interactions with each other but no real barriers to interaction between groups
* Purpose
    * The federation rarely has a specific goal of its own other than to collect and connect as many individuals as possible
    * Within the federation, the purposes are often as many and varied as the number of connections between members
* Social Norms
    * One rudimentary set of social norms, the bare minimum that prevents the federation from falling apart

Examples:

* [Facebook](https://facebook.com)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com)
