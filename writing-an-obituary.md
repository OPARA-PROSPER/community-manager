# Writing an Obituary

Notable people in the community may literally die. As a community manager, it can fall on your shoulders to inform others why someone is suddenly no longer participating or contributing.

A memorial post should contain the following:

1. A statement of the facts - the person who passed away, how, when, etc
1. What did they contribute? - a few highlights of why they will be missed
1. What can people do? - often people will want to do something for the deceased's family, even if it is small like send flowers or contribute to a charity
