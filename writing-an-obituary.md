# Writing an Obituary

Notable people in the community may literally die. As a community manager, it can fall on your shoulders to inform others why someone is suddenly no longer participating or contributing.

A memorial post should contain the following:

1. A statement of the facts - the person who passed away, how, when, etc
1. What did they contribute? - a few highlights of why they will be missed
1. What can people do? - because people will have feelings, often they will want to _do_ something. This helps them process those feelings. Having something they can do (that is approved by the family of the deceased), such as sending flowers or donating to a charity, will help.
