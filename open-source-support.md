# Open Source Support

Supporting open source projects is very different from traditional customer support. In open source, there isn't a traditional business/customer relationship. People will fall into the horrible "customer is always right" pattern often and it is going to be your job to help educate them on the culture around open source.

## There Is No Customer

I don't know how it is in the rest of the world, but the United States has a real problem with [the customer is always right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_customer_is_always_right). Many people have [turned this adage into a bludgeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EJw6oGSft0) to use against customer service people to get their way. But that's not how open source works. There is no customer in open source. So there is, theoretically, no way for people to demand they get their way. That doesn't mean that they won't resort to other forms of emotional blackmail to try to get it.

Examples:

* "I can't use [the software] until [some feature] is added"
* "I'm going back to [some other editor] until this is fixed"[^1]
* "I can't believe that this is [current year] and [the software] still doesn't do [some function]"
* "If you want [the software] to succeed, you should make [the software work like I want]"

The best response to these attempts is simply no response at all. It's essentially the community management equivalent of "it is our policy to never negotiate with terrorists".

## We All Own The Code

One of the major reasons why open source is so successful is that anyone with the spare time, patience and expertise can help improve it. It is true that not everyone will have all of those requirements or have them in sufficient quantity. But perhaps they know someone who does? Maybe they could pay to have what they want implemented? There are lots of options for people who actually want something valuable rather than just want something for nothing.

## Everyone Has the Right to Fork the Project

Sometimes the people who own the project and the people requesting a change have a philosophical difference. 

[^1]: Multiple people employing this particular tactic have admitted to me that it was an empty threat. They had no intention of using some other editor.
