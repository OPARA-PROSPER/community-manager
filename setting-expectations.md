# Setting Expectations

Speaking with the public in an official capacity can be a bit risky because people have a tendency to hear what they want rather than what is truly said. These are the techniques I've collected for dealing with common situations.

## Never Communicate Dates

... or ETAs. ... or work estimates. ... or anything relating to time, really :laughing:

If you give a date or time, people will not read anything else other than the date or time and believe it to be a hard commitment. People don't even know they're doing it a lot of the time. They're busy and they read everything you said but all that is important to them is the date, so that's all they remember. [Apple](http://www.apple.com) does this with virtually all product launches. They announce a product only when it can be pre-ordered or purchased almost immediately. It is essentially an extension of the old adage "underpromise and overdeliver".

People are tempted to give dates when they believe them to be solid. The problem is that these beliefs are based on the best of intentions, they're the dates that you will hit only if everything goes according to plan. So then people are tempted to give a date with some extra padding. No matter what date you give, it is possible to miss it.

A manager I once had was concerned because I occasionally missed dates I had committed to when estimating projects. This was a problem for him, so we had a talk and he told me he only wanted dates that I could "100% guarantee". I told him that I couldn't do that because I can't predict the future. He wouldn't relent, so I told him "10 years. I can guarantee that, unless I die, I can deliver this functionality in 10 years or less." He was less than enthused :trollface:

The only date you can't miss is one you don't commit to, so just don't communicate dates ... ever.

### You Can Tie Features to Versions Rather Than Dates

One technique I commonly use with Atom is I will say that "X is currently scheduled to go out with version Y", where X is a change, feature or bug fix. Of course, since I never give a date when version Y will be available, it gives people an idea of how long they will have to wait without ever committing to a specific date. But I will _only_ say this when the change, feature or bug fix is already committed to `master`. This is a much more realistic commitment and it gets around people's irrationality associated with dates.

## Be Clear When Speaking Only for Yourself

When I was still only a volunteer on the Atom project, [I had a canned disclaimer](https://discuss.atom.io/t/why-is-atom-so-slow/11376/13?u=leedohm) that I would insert in some messages or posts:

> _Disclaimer:_ I am not an employee of GitHub nor a member of the Atom Core team. I am just an enthusiastic volunteer :grinning:

I used this liberally when speaking unofficially in official locations. Which, technically, was everywhere that I tended to talk about Atom. I would use this to separate my personal opinions or thoughts from official statements or commitments. And it was good that I did it too, because I would often get people replying that [they had assumed I was a GitHub employee.](https://discuss.atom.io/t/tabulators-are-not-aligned-correctly/6182/8?u=leedohm)

Now that I am a GitHub employee and we have done away with the distinction between Atom Core developers and volunteer maintainers, it is still helpful to be very clear about:

* When I am speaking for myself rather than the project or company
    * "It is my personal belief ..."
    * "On a personal level ..."
* When I am communicating opinions rather than facts
    * "I believe ..."
    * "I feel ..."
    * "I think ..."
* When I am communicating hopes or desires rather than plans
    * "I, personally, would love to see ..."
    * "My hope is that as a team we can ..."

It is important to note that I never will speak of the beliefs, opinions, hopes or desires of any specific individual, my team or my company. If people want to hear such things, they will have to go to the source. But I will speak of my own beliefs, hopes or desires ... I'm just very clear about it.
