# When Not To Respond

At times knowing when not to respond is just as important as knowing what to say when you do. Some people will attempt to derail a conversation to push their agenda or simply for attention. Learning how to not reward or even subtly punish such behavior can help guide conversations in a more constructive direction. Additionally, being self-aware enough to know when you will exhibit less self-control is very important.

## You Don't Have To Respond

There are two rules of thumb here:

1. Not everything deserves a reply
2. The things that deserve a reply, don't need one today

You can be judicious in participating in discussions and often it can be healthier if moderators take something of a back seat because that allows others in the community to step up and become respected resources.

## Extinction - How Not Responding Can Guide A Conversation

There is a concept called [extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_(psychology)) in psychology where withholding the stimulus for a behavior can inhibit that behavior in others. It is taught in management training as a way to quell outbursts from employees who are prone to interrupting. It's essentially based on creating an "uncomfortable silence".[^1]

To give a general idea of how this technique works, let's take a look at an example. Let's say that you're running a meeting. A discussion is happening but a particular participant is interrupting you repeatedly. In this case you would:

1. Immediately stop speaking
2. Turn to look at the person interrupting
3. Wait a couple seconds
4. Continue on with what you were saying without addressing what was interjected

This lets everyone in the room know that you don't approve of the behavior, it draws attention to the negative behavior, but isn't as shaming as a public rebuke. It works best when you're in a position of power, such as being a manager in a meeting of individual contributors, but it can also work in situations where people just want to hear what you have to say.

In virtual environments it is important to note that in a lot of cases not speaking is the same as not existing. So how do you convey that same feeling of "I'm looking at you" without posting something? It takes some practice, but when you post to a message board or in a chat channel you tend to get into a rhythm. Other people who are involved in the conversation will tend to pick up on that cadence. So a longer than normal pause in between messages can work. You can also "talk around" the person interrupting by addressing someone else, even if you have to bring someone new into the conversation in order to do it.

[^1]: For this reason, this technique may work better or worse on people from certain cultures. Some cultures are much more tolerant of long silences in the middle of conversations.

## Being Self-Aware

Guiding a community is stressful work. You have to hold yourself to the highest of standards while everyone else gets to be human. Knowing when you're not at your best will help you [prevent embarassing situations](https://youtu.be/0VYvdsrV6Lw?t=60). Fortunately, you don't have to be at your 100% best *all the time*. But when a tough conversation comes up, you should ask yourself if you are:

* Tired
* Hungry
* Upset
* Preoccupied
* Worried
* Anxious

If you're any of these things, you should probably respond later when you can have a clearer frame of mind. It takes practice, but you can work a little mental check-in into your routine.

## But I **Have** To Say **Something**

There are times when you have just had it up to **here** with these people :rage: You feel like you're going to explode if you don't get what you're thinking off your chest. You're human. It happens to all of us. Here's what I do when I am in this frame of mind: I write the reply and then delete it. At many times I delete far more than I post.

Psychologists have shown repeatedly that imagining doing things has a lot of the same impact mentally as actually doing them. So by writing out your reply and venting all your frustration you can release it and move on, whether or not the other person will ever know. If you're worried that you'll accidentally post it you can type it in a text editor so that isn't a risk.
